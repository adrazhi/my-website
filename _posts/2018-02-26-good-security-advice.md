title: On Good Security Advice
---

As a software engineer you get a lot of security advice. 
What might surprise you is that the advice you receive 
can be useless or slow you down tremendeously. 
Often times we speak of this friction that exists 
between developers and security engineer and one of the 
greatest skills you can gain as a developer is the ability 
to distinguish good security advice from bad security advice. 
Doing so will give you the power to gaze out into the future 
and make smart decisions. 

But what is good advice? What do we mean by advice? 
Fundamentally, it's a recommendation for how to proceed in 
the future. For example: "use vault to store your secrets", 
or "make sure you properly validate user input" or "make sure
to sign and verify docker images to prevent MITM attacks" etc. 
Good security advice relies on two things: 
- Good understanding of how the ecosystem works (technologies, CI pipeline, deployment etc)
- The circumstances of a parcitular piece of code, service, technology that is the target of the advice. 

Most people think their intuition can help separate the good advice from all the poor advice when they get it. This is not
good advice about advice. 

*Use your intuition to ask questions, not to answer them*

As a develoer, you must train yourself to understand what characteristics make "good" advice and how you shoudl employ it 
when you recognize it. 

## Characteristics of good security advice
Good security advice is often based on a casual theory, in 
other words, good advice in based on a theory that explains 
*what* and *why*
