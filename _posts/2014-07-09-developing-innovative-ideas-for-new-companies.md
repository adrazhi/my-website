---

I have successfully completed <strong>Developing Innovative Ideas for New Companies</strong>, an online course offered by [University of Maryland](http://www.umd.edu/), College Park.

Grade: 95.8% | [View certificate]({{ site.url }}/files/innovativeideas_2014.pdf)

## Course description:
>This course assists aspiring entrepreneurs in developing great ideas into great companies. With strong economies presenting rich opportunities for new venture creation, and challenging economic times presenting the necessity for many to make their own job, the need to develop the skills to develop and act on innovative business opportunities is ever present.
>
>Using proven content, methods, and models for new venture opportunity assessment and analysis, students will learn how to enhance their entrepreneurial mindset and develop their functional skill sets to see and act entrepreneurially. The initial steps to creating a business plan, and raising financial capital to launch the firm, are examined as well. Our goal is to demystify the startup process, and to help you build the skills to identify and act on innovative opportunities now, and in the future.
>
>With this course, students experience a sampling of the ideas and techniques explored in the University of Marylandâ€™s Online Master of Technology Entrepreneurship.
