<div class="about">
    <h1>Hey there!</h1>
    <p>I'm Fábio, a Software Engineer who cares about using the best practices to build great products and services.</p>
    <p>No one is good in everything but as an engineer, i'm highly motivated to work with new technologies and understanding how they work.</p>
    <p>I'm NOT the typical "code monkey" and i don't work only with a single programming language, tool, design pattern, protocol, etc. Unique problems require unique solutions and that's why it's so important to me to spend time to fully understand the problem before working on a potential solution.</p>
    <p>In my free time, i enjoy running outside, mountain bike riding, listening music, watching tv shows, traveling and contributing to open source community.</p>
    <p>I'm always looking for good opportunities to work with smart people on awesome projects, so feel free to email me: <a href="mailto:ffsantos92@gmail.com">ffsantos92@gmail.com</a></p>
